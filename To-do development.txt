How to abort a running batch job: System.abortJob(AsyncApexJob ID). Example:
-------------------------------
global override void execute(Database.BatchableContext BC, List<SObject> scope) {
  try {
    /** do stuff **/
  } catch (Exception ex) {
    // The finish method isn't called when we abort, so let's directly call it
    finish(BC); 
    // Get current jobId from batch context to pass to the abort method
    System.abortJob(BC.getJobId());
    // Prevent rest of code in execute method from firing by exiting with return statement
    return;
  } 
}

Exception properties - example
-------------------- 
e.getLineNumber()
e.getMessage()
e.getStackTrace() // Will stack trace incude line number, class name, and method name?
